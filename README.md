# The Gardener

This is a robotic gardening platform that is designed to exceed what can be bought for domestic use.  The goal is to have AI assisted SLAM and GPS.
It will also use low impact blades for lawn clipping and run of LIPO.  It needs to be able to run on steep inclines. It will not be collecting refuse.
